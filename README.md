75 Jokers. A 3-month vanilla-friendly solo project aiming to make Retriggers, card Suits, Ranks, and other vanilla mechanics fully realized. 

Disclaimer: Most of the sprites are not my own. The majority are edited from google images, aside from a couple Joker sprites I could not find the creators of and a Legendary Joker background taken from All in Jest. Should people enjoy the mod, I'll put more work into original sprites.
